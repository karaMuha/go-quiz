The purpose of this quiz app is to play around with graphql and later on with graph databases. My idea is to connect go-quiz and [go-social](https://github.com/karaMuha/go-social)so that users from go-social can answer quiz questions and other users who have achieved similar results int the quiz are suggested as new contacts.
